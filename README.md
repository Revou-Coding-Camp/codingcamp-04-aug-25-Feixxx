This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently.

HTML serves as the foundational structure of the application. It includes essential elements such as input fields for adding a task and a date, a button to submit new tasks, and an unordered list where the tasks will be displayed.

CSS is used to create an appealing and modern visual design. This project adopts a glassmorphism style, giving the main container a semi-transparent, frosted-glass effect that creates an elegant and clean look. The CSS also handles the overall layout, colors, and typography to ensure the interface is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

JavaScript is the core of the application, handling all the interactive functionality. When a user enters a task and clicks "Add," JavaScript captures the input data, dynamically creates a new list item, and appends it to the task list. It also listens for clicks on the "Delete" buttons, allowing users to remove tasks from the list instantly.

In essence, this project is an excellent example for beginners to understand how these three core web technologies work together. It demonstrates the fundamental principles of building a responsive and interactive web application, making it a valuable learning tool for anyone new to web development.
